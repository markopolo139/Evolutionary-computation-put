\section{Problem description}
We are given three columns of integers with a row for each node. The first two columns contain x
and y coordinates of the node positions in a plane. The third column contains node costs. The goal is
to select exactly 50\% of the nodes (if the number of nodes is odd we round the number of nodes to
be selected up) and form a Hamiltonian cycle (closed path) through this set of nodes such that the
sum of the total length of the path plus the total cost of the selected nodes is minimized.

% In this assignment, we analyze the structure of the search space by examining the similarity between local optima. We generate 1000 random local optima and calculate their similarity to:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The best solution found within the 1000 local optima.
%     \item A high-quality solution found by an Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm.
%     \item The average similarity to all other local optima.
% \end{itemize}
% We use two similarity measures: the number of common edges and the number of common selected nodes.

\section{Conclusions}

We analyzed the correlation between the objective function value of local optima and their similarity to reference solutions (best found, best known) and the average similarity to other local optima.

The results are presented in the charts above, showing the relationship for both similarity measures: common edges and common selected nodes.
