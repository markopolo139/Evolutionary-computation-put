\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

To analyze the fitness landscape, we performed the following steps for each problem instance (TSPA, TSPB):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sample Generation}: We generated 1000 random solutions and applied a greedy local search (steepest descent) to each, resulting in 1000 local optima.
    \item \textbf{Reference Solutions}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Best of 1000}: The solution with the lowest objective function value among the 1000 local optima.
        \item \textit{Best External}: A high-quality solution generated by running an Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm for a fixed time budget.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Similarity Calculation}: For each of the 1000 local optima, we calculated its similarity to the reference solutions and the average similarity to all other 999 local optima.
\end{enumerate}

We used two distinct similarity measures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Common Nodes}: The number of nodes selected in both solutions (intersection of the sets of selected nodes).
    \item \textbf{Common Edges}: The number of edges shared between the two solutions. Since the graph is undirected, the edge (u, v) is considered identical to (v, u).
\end{itemize}

For each combination of instance, similarity measure, and reference type, we plotted the objective function value against the similarity score and calculated the correlation coefficient.
